I liked the user interface:
The sequence of process met my expectation:
Prefer IBA over regular password systems:
Recommend IBA for other courses:
The process of authentication took too much time:
Took too many keystrokes:
Took too many mouse moves:
Password was hard to remember:
The system was confusing:
Prefer if I only had 12-key pad (e.g. PDAs, cell phones):
Prefer text password (typed) over IBA:
