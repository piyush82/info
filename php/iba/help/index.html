<u>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</u><br><br>
<a name="admin"><b>For IBA Administrators</b></a><br>
1. How do I setup another TA's account?<br>
-> Just login using username <i>admin</i> and the corresponding password from the UF-IBA Administrators section of the webpage. Once
you have been successfully logged in, you will have the capabilities to admin the admin-list file and also create another TA's account
<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
2. How do I disable a particular TA's admin privilages?<br>
-> Again log in using <i>admin</i> as the username and the corresponding password using the UF-IBA Administrators login form in the home page.
After you are successfully logged in, then remove the TA's entry from the admin-list panel and submit the form. This would disable that TA's
admin privilages.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
3. Can multiple TAs have same admin privilages i.e. can they access the same resources?<br>
-> Yes, multiple TA admin accounts having same control domain will be able to access the same resource files from the course subdirectory. The
control domain name has to be specified while creating a TA's account. Make sure to specify the same control domain name example: cop5615fa06
while creating their account.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
4. What are the necessary fields required in the class gradebook for the system to function correctly?<br>
-> Class gradebook must contain a header row as the first row of the csv file. It must contain at least these 4 columns titled exactly as
"UFID", "Last Name", "First Name" and "Email". Other than these it may have any number of columns like "hw1", "proj1" etc. etc as desired.
<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
5. How can I make certain columns in the class gradebook not accessible by the students?<br>
-> Any column whose corresponding header name begins with ## is not displayed to the students. For example you want to have a "letter grade"
column in your gradebook file but do not want the letter grades to be displayed yet to the students, you can name the header row title for
that column as "##letter grade".<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
6. What is the structure for the class roster file?<br>
-> The class roster csv file must contain just 2 columns containing only the ufids and the full name of the students in that class and without 
any header title.
<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
7. I have forgotten my password. How can I retrive it?<br>
-> IBA Administrators' passwords are securely stored as a one way hash value, so there is no way to retrieve the password corresponding to the hash
hence if you have forgotten your password contact the system admin who has control over <i>admin</i> username in order to reset your password to a new
one. You will be first asked to change your password next time you login after it has been resetted and then you can choose a proper password.
<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
8. How do I access the submitted homeworks for grading them?<br>
-> When the IBA System is first setup and when TAs accounts are created by the <i>admin</i> the system also creates a homework directory
where all the submitted files are stored. You must have read access to that directory. Contact your TA supervisor for getting appropriate
access rights. After that you should be able to access the files from any CISE shell.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br> 
<a name="general"><b>For General Survey Users</b></a><br>
1. What is UF-IBA?<br>
-> UF-IBA is a new take on user authentication which is theoretically more secure and psychologically supposed to be more user friendly. It replaces the
traditional text passwords with set of images as passwords. This user study has been designed to find out how practical the system is and to
find out whether it is more acceptable to general users compared to text based password authentication systems.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
2. I forgot my image password set. What should I do?<br>
-> There is a link on the homepage to retrieve forgotten passwords. Once identity of the user has been confirmed using his/her secret question and
answer, the system emails the password image set to the email address used during registration.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
3. I want to change my password. What should I do?<br>
-> After you have been successfully logged into the system using your current password image set, select the 'Change Password' option from the
IBA Control Panel. Next time when you try to login, the system will prompt you to select your password image set. You can now change the password
image set. Remember you will have to again undergo training on the newer password set.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
4. How many images should I select in my password set? Is there a minimum number of images that I have to select per screen?<br>
-> There is no niminum number of images requirement per grid screen. There are a total of 3 image grid screens. You may not select any image from a
particular image grid screen if you do not like any of the images in that grid. There is one restriction though - your password image set must
contain at least 5 images from these three grids. You can use any image selection combinations per grid as long as this restriction is satisfied
in the end of your password selection process.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
5. I want to retake the training again on my password image set. How can I do that?<br>
-> Logon to the system using your password image set. Then choose the option to 'Re-enable Training' from the IBA Control panel once you have
successfully logged in. Next time when you login into the UF-IBA system you will be allowed to retake the training again.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
6. Is there any user survey planned for us to take? How will I do the survey?<br>
-> Yes, there are 4 user surveys planned to be given at different point of time during the duration of this study. Once a survey has been given, it
will be displayed on the screen after you have successfully logged into the system. There will be no more than 10 - 15 questions per survey. The
survey will be available for taking for few days to a week or so from the initial date of listing.<a href="#top">^</a><br><br>
7. How often am I supposed to logon into the system for this study?<br>
-> Please try to login into UF-IBA system at least once per week. If you do not login into the system for 7 days in a row, the system will
automatically send you a short reminder once per week of inactivity to the email address used during the registration process.

<a name="student"><b>For Specific Course Users</b></a><br>
Note: These FAQs are in addition to the FAQs for the General Survey User. Please refer to those too in addition to the ones listed below.<br><br>
1. If I submit my homeowrks / projects multiple times are all the versions stored at the server?<br>
-> No, the server only stores the version that you submitted last. Therefore after the submission deadline has passed do not try to resubmit
your homework as it will erase your previous homework which you had submitted well within the deadline resulting in late submission.
